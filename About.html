            <p>Am Grace Wacheke Maina,also known as Gracie(born in
                August16,2001),am a student at AkiraChix Campus and also
                a professional dancer.Born and raised in Nakuru,studied my primary
                school at Holy Trinity Academy(2006-2015),I later
                joined highschool in <br>Nyeri(2016-2019),Mt.Carmel Girls Secondary.Am the second born
                of four brothers and one sister,we live in Gilgil,Nakuru
                county.My main aspiration is to become more of a
                tech woman in the industry and a sister to everyone who looks
                up to me.I love Mitchell Obama,Kanze Dena and Mother Teresa,these are
                the women who inspire me in every way in my life.</p>


            <p>I love to make friends and always stay happy always,
                this always<br> makes me increase myself_esteem and helps me
                not to be <br>an introvert.The main things that make me always
                grateful is <br>to know each time I wake up and am in good health
                and <br>ready to start a new day.Everyday I wake up,am always<br> on my knees
                saying thank you to Almighty God.

                Philippians 4:6-7<br>
                Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation,<br>
                by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your <br>
                requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all<br>
                understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in <br>Christ Jesus.
            </p>


            <p>My hobbies are mainly cooking,watching movies and also listening to music.<br>
                I wasn't actually born as a book reader but sometime I try to read some <br>novel
                like,The three investigators and Born a crime,among others.When I was <br>young I always
                dreamnt of becoming one of the best novelist.....hope it comes <br>true.Lastly the most things
                that I basically love to do is dancing,It has health benefits from.<br>
                relieving stress, and body sculpting to name a few. But it's also great for mental<br>
                with a sense of community with people that have the <br>same interests and passion.
